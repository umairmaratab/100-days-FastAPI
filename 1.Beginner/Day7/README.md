# Update Post
Now to implement update post we can use PUT method, to update post we have to provide that specific attribute which we want to update.
e.g
In our case let's say we want to update title, so we will provide an updated title in the payload and for other things we have to provide other data as well so we can just provide the previous data (already present data)

<This wraps up our CRUD Operations>

FastAPI Comes with automatic documentation, which is best part of fastapi, document is generated by SWAGGER UI.
To access it you can use defaulturl/docs e.g http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
Another one is:
